# CallBlocker

CallBlocker is a simple app that allows you to

* block unwanted calls from certain numbers or private numbers,
* enter numbers to be blocked with wildcards (for instance, you can block whole prefixes or companies),
* get notified about blocked calls (optional),
* view statistics about which caller was blocked how often and when they have called the last time.

CallBlocker is not intended as a feature-rich call-spam fighting app,
but as a replacement for Android's missing call blocking feature.
